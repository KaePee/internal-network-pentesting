# Internal Network Penetration Testing Guidelines
1. **This guide is intended to provide a general framework for creating your documentation. While it outlines key elements to consider, you are encouraged to include any additional relevant information that may be necessary to produce a comprehensive and well-structured report on an internal network assessment.**
2. **Generally, most of the scenarios given are just to emulate the real world. They are made to test your ability to demonstrate how you will approach a network penetration test in an organizational setting.**
3. **The output of the commands you run are not of interest here.**

## Scope
The scope of engagement comprises of an internal network: `10.10.10.0/24` and a domain name: `https://virtualinfosecafrica.com/`

# Host Discovery
- Using _Nmap_, demonstrate how you will do a host discovery on the scope above. Describe what it means to do a host discovery and include screenshots of the commands you would use with nmap to do a host discovery with explanations on the options you chose for the command
- Assuming 15 hosts are up, what will be your next steps? Demonstrate how you will filter your output and save them into a file indicating hosts which are up.
- Use the _Nmap_ output below to demonstrate the above point. 

```nmap

Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.2

Nmap done at Fri Sep 12 10:45:30 2024 -- 256 IP addresses (15 hosts up) scanned in 30.00 seconds
```
- For the domain provided in the [Scope](#scope), demonstrate how you can do a subdomain enumeration using a tool like `aiodnsbrute`. 

# Service Discovery and Port Scanning
- Now you have a fair idea of the hosts that respond to pings. Explain why you have to do service discovery / port scanning and why it is necessary. 
- Using _Nmap_ do a service discovery and save the output into a greppable nmap file. 
- Separate the output of the results into their respective protocols. 
- Use the data below as a guide

- Take note of the service versions, use resources like Exploitdb and [MITRE CVE](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/search_cve_list.html) to identify relevant vulnerabilities associated with the services indicated in the data above. 

# Vulnerability Scanning
- Using your protocol specific file you created under service discovery, scan for vulnerabilities with the _Metasploit Auxilliary module_. (Scan for login vulnerabilities - common credentials for the following services: mysql, vnc, rdp, smb), use appropriate wordlists for these services.
- Assuming you have to develop your own custom wordlist, demonstrate how you will go about that using `cewl`. Describe situations when it will be needed to 
- Show the procedure used during scanning of the vulnerabilites associated with these services
- Take screenshots of revelant commands to support your descriptions

# Web-Based Attack Surfaces
- Now, using your http/https hosts file, use `eyewitness` to show the command and options that you will use to open the links and take screenshots of the web servers. 
- Include options for `eyewitness` to load non-standard http/https ports.
# Generating Payloads
- Now, assuming host `10.10.10.55` runs an Apache Tomcat web server(Java based), explain how you will use `msfvenom` to generate a payload that can trigger a TCP bind shell when executed by an attacker
- Do same for host `10.10.10.30` with the assumption it is running a Python server that can execute `base64` encoded payloads.
- Take screenshots after running the commands to create the payloads using `msfvenom` and also the directory containing both payloads for the Java server and the Python server after generating the payloads
