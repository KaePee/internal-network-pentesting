# Internal Network Penetration Testing Guidelines
1. **This guide is intended to provide a general framework for creating your documentation. While it outlines key elements to consider, you are encouraged to include any additional relevant information that may be necessary to produce a comprehensive and well-structured report on an internal network assessment.**
2. **Generally, most of the scenarios given are just to emulate the real world. They are made to test your ability to demonstrate how you will approach a network penetration test in an organizational setting.**
3. **The output of the commands you run are not of interest here.**

## Scope
The scope of engagement comprises of an internal network: `10.10.10.0/24` and a domain name: `https://virtualinfosecafrica.com/`

# Host Discovery
- Using _Nmap_, demonstrate how you will do a host discovery on the scope above. Describe what it means to do a host discovery and include screenshots of the commands you would use with nmap to do a host discovery with explanations on the options you chose for the command
- Assuming 15 hosts are up, what will be your next steps? Demonstrate how you will filter your output and save them into a file indicating hosts which are up.
- Use the _Nmap_ output below to demonstrate the above point. 

```nmap 
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.1
Host is up (0.0010s latency).
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.2

```
- For the domain provided in the [Scope](#scope), demonstrate how you can do a subdomain enumeration using a tool like `aiodnsbrute`.
